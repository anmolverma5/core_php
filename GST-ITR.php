             <p>Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a kind of indirect tax imposed by the government on the various range of household items and the services offered by 
             any business to the individuals. However, it is collected by the relevant businesses only but has to be submitted to the government afterwards according to the norms
             set by the concerned department. It was first propped by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government back in 2000 and it took almost 17 years to make it a fully fledged law
             in the country for the benefit of the citizens. It came into effect on July 1, 2017 under the slogan ONE NATION ONE TAX. It proved to a gigantic reform in the 
             tax system of the country since ages.</p>

<p>Income tax is a tax that is imposed by the government on individual’s income from any of the sources he/she is indulged into with a sole motive of running the government smoothly. In layman terms, government functions with the taxpayer’s money. Every person in the country is liable to pay Income Tax
to the government based on the protocols set by the Income Tax Department. Failure to do so or hiding income is a punishable offence.</p>
